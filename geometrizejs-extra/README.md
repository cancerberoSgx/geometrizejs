## TODO

- [ ] magica to more formats ? 
- [ ] bitmap output - currently we raster the svg and we should be transforming the generated shapeÂ¡s image data.
- [ ] verify input from url
- [ ] document src/options.ts
- [ ] options in readme
- [ ] verify bitmap-regions works
- [x] browser tests
- [x] readme TOC
- [x] node.js tests
- [x] svg optimizer
- [x] use svg-to-png-converter to render bitmap formats
- [x] notify listeners between N iterations passing current models  (format agnostic) (so they can take interval screenshots)

## Toys

- [ ] a toy that randomly choose regions and options. defines new dimention for iteration, region-iteration and iterations inside of it. In the first one we don't apply algorithm just do it.
- [ ] tool that progressively animates svg shapes form one frame wo another a(and create new ones) to simulate primitive to realism.
- [ ] magica as a toy to build gif anims
  - [ ] use it to animate series
  - [ ] use it to animate progress in between nth steps
-  experiment self-drawing. what if from blank, we draw 5 primitives, then stop and use that as an input and draw some more, etc etc.
  - [ ] similar to previous, but at some points, put back the original image with modifications on top or blended so the algorithm still have a direction.
  - [ ] in general investigate what the result of building more than 1 model in parallel to compare ot be more artistic the second one could consume its own output, consume an image with an effect, etc.
  - [ ] similar - two models, one working with image effect (charcoal or paint style) and then how can they be blend

## ideas

- [ ] configuration to limit the size/length of shapes (i want them to be small)
- [ ] configuration for mutation magic numbers.
- [ ] research if svg simplify and smooth could work?
- [ ] serialize iteration state: I should be able to save current iteration on an image (json?) and later load it and continue (preserving score and internals)
- HTML API to optimally update a svg document on each step
- example of using canvas to render steps ?

- [ ] Research SVG post processing
  - [ ] SVG paths can be transformed with "simplify" (sharpen  by reducing nodes) and with smothing (adds nodes and transform ) 


## Ideas for geometrize-haxe core library

- [ ] extensibilty: geometrize should allow users to:
  - [ ] add new shapes types
  - [ ] pre / post process shape mutations and rasterize
- [ ] text shape - equivalent to rotated rectangle ? User can provide list of words or single letters. - configure font style - letter vs word vs paragraph.
    - [ ] for bitmap support we could, before processing 1) have the words/letters in svg 2) rasterize to bitmap 3) load as jimp/magica and transform(translate/rotate) using these to comply with rotated_rectangle and mask colors too.


## Complex / not important: 
- [ ] refined styles:
  - [ ] brushes / textures ? https://github.com/Tw1ddle/geometrize-haxe/issues/9
  - [ ] gradients ?
  - [ ] borders
